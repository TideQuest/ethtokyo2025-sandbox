/**
 * This file tests the operator registration and task creation.
 * The tests were initially written using Node's own testing framework, but
 * later switched to Jest. Thus, the tests were initially written in a nested
 * format, but were later refactored to use Jest's `describe` and `it` functions.
 * Apologies for the hence resulting inconsistency in the code style.
 *
 * The nesting of tests is helpful as the tests logically depend on each other,
 * and the nesting helps save time by not repeating the same setup code.
